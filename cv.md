### About me  
I have been learning programming for a bit more than 1 year. My main goal is to become a professional web-developer. During my styding process I improve my skills using modern developers tools and programming languages features. I consider that today is quite important not to restrict yourself that is why I learn a frontend side as well as backend side of web-developing. Speaking about my personal qualities, I am fast learner and try to know something new every day.
